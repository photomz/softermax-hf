        Run evaluation and returns metrics.

        The calling script will be responsible for providing a method to compute metrics, as they are task-dependent
        (pass it to the init `compute_metrics` argument).

        You can also subclass and override this method to inject custom behavior.

        Args:
            eval_dataset (`Dataset`, *optional*):
                Pass a dataset if you wish to override `self.eval_dataset`. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns
                not accepted by the `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. It must implement the `__len__`
                method.
            ignore_keys (`List[str]`, *optional*):
                A list of keys in the output of your model (if it is a dictionary) that should be ignored when
                gathering predictions.
            metric_key_prefix (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"eval"`):
                An optional prefix to be used as the metrics key prefix. For example the metrics "bleu" will be named
                "eval_bleu" if the prefix is "eval" (default)

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing the evaluation loss and the potential metrics computed from the predictions. The
            dictionary also contains the epoch number which comes from the training state.
